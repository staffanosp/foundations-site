          Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991.
          Originally known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam
          Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul
          McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older
          brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) later joined as a fifth member,
          finalising the group's core lineup. During the course of their
          existence, they had various lineup changes, with the Gallagher
          brothers remaining the only staple members.

          Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and
          released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The
          following year they recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995)
          with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with peers
          Blur. Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, (What's
          the Story) Morning Glory? was also an international chart success and
          became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it
          stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the
          biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers
          featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their disputes and wild
          lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an
          audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK
          history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be
          Here Now. It became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.

          Oasis' popularity later declined and McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999
          as Oasis released Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were
          replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer and former Ride
          guitarist Andy Bell. White departed in 2004, replaced by Zak Starkey
          and later Chris Sharrock as touring members. Oasis released three more
          studio albums, Heathen Chemistry (2002), Don't Believe the Truth
          (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008). The group abruptly disbanded
          after the departure of Noel Gallagher in August 2009.

          As of 2022, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide. They are
          among the most successful acts on the UK Singles Chart and Albums
          Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one
          albums. The band also achieved three platinum albums in the US. They
          won 17 NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six
          Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to
          Music and one for the "Best Album of the Last 30 Years" for (What's
          the Story) Morning Glory?. They were nominated for two Grammy Awards.
