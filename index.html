      <h2>Definitely Maybe</h2>
      <h3>Oasis</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely Maybe is the debut studio album by English rock band Oasis,
        released by Creation Records on 29 August 1994. Oasis booked Monnow
        Valley Studio near Rockfield in late 1993 to record the album and worked
        with producer Dave Batchelor, whom band member Noel Gallagher knew from
        his days working as a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets, though sessions
        were unsatisfactory and Batchelor was subsequently fired. It is the only
        studio album to feature all five original members, as founding member
        drummer Tony McCarroll was fired from the band in 1995. In January 1994,
        the group set about re-recording the album at Sawmills Studio in
        Cornwall, where sessions were produced by Noel alongside Mark Coyle. The
        results were still deemed unsatisfactory; in desperation, Creation's
        Marcus Russell contacted engineer and producer Owen Morris, who
        eventually w orked on mastering the album at Johnny Marr's studio in
        Manchester.

      <h2>(What's the Story?) Morning Glory</h2>
      <h3>Oasis</h3>
      <p>
        (What's the Story) Morning Glory? is the second studio album by English
        rock band Oasis. Released on 2 October 1995 by Creation Records, it was
        produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist and main songwriter
        Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a
        significant departure from the group's previous album Definitely Maybe
        (1994). Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and
        placed more emphasis on "huge" choruses,[1] with the string arrangements
        and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the
        group's debut album. Morning Glory was the group's first album with
        drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll (though McCarroll still
        appeared on the album, drumming on the track "Some Might Say").

      <h2>Be Here Now</h2>
      <h3>Oasis</h3>
      <p>
        Be Here Now is the third studio album by English rock band Oasis,
        released on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. The album was recorded
        at multiple recording studios in London, including Abbey Road Studios,
        as well as Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. Although most tracks retain the
        anthemic quality of previous releases, the songs on Be Here Now are
        longer and contain many guitar overdubs. Noel Gallagher said this was
        done to make the album sound as "colossal" as possible. The album cover
        features a shot of the band members at Stocks House in Hertfordshire. It
        is the last Oasis studio album to feature founding members guitarist
        Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and bassist Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan as the two
        left in 1999.

      <h2>Homework</h2>
      <h3>Daft Punk</h3>
      <p>
        Homework is the debut studio album by the French electronic music duo
        Daft Punk, released on 20 January 1997 by Virgin Records and Soma
        Quality Recordings. It was later released in the United States on 25
        March 1997. As the duo's first project on a major label, they produced
        the album's tracks without plans to release them, but after initially
        considering releasing them as separate singles, they considered the
        material good enough for an album. Homework's success brought worldwide
        attention to French house music. The album charted in 14 countries,
        peaking at number 3 on the French Albums Chart, number 150 on the United
        States Billboard 200 and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. "Da Funk"
        and "Around the World" became U.S. Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play
        number-one singles, the latter of which reached number 61 on the
        Billboard Hot 100. By February 2001, the album had sold more than two
        million copies worldwide and received several gold and platinum
        certifications. The album is widely hailed as a classic of the French
        house genre and a significant influence on subsequent dance music.

      <h2>The Shape of Punk to Come</h2>
      <h3>Refused</h3>
      <p>
        The Shape of Punk to Come: A Chimerical Bombination in 12 Bursts, often
        shortened to The Shape of Punk to Come, is the third album by Swedish
        hardcore punk band Refused, released on 27 October 1998[1] through
        Burning Heart Records. Although Refused broke up only months after the
        album's release, The Shape of Punk to Come has since found an audience
        for the band and largely contributed to their posthumous fame, as well
        as inspiring many later artists in a wide range of genres.[12][13]
        Kerrang! magazine listed The Shape of Punk to Come at #13 on their 50
        Most Influential Albums of All Time list in 2003.

      <h2>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</h2>
      <h3>Wu-Tang Clan</h3>
      <p>
        Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is the debut studio album by American
        hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, released on November 9, 1993, by Loud
        Records. Recording sessions took place during late 1992 to early 1993 at
        Firehouse Studio in New York City, and the album was produced by the
        group's de facto leader RZA. Its title originates from the martial arts
        films Enter the Dragon (1973) and The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978).[3]
        The gritty, distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created
        a blueprint for hardcore hip hop during the 1990s, and helped return New
        York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly
        influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members'
        explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a
        template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark
        release in the era of hip hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its
        influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast rappers,
        including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.
